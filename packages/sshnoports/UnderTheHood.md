# What's happening under the hood?

**Note**: This document describes version 4.0.0-rc.2 or greater; v4.0.0 will be
released on or about Aug 20 2023.

## Overview
There are three atSigns involved - one for each of
- the noports daemon program (`sshnpd`) which runs on the device you want to 
  ssh to
- the noports client program (`sshnp`) which you run on the device you want to 
  ssh from
- the noports tcp rendezvous program (`sshrvd`)

The programs communicate via the atProtocol and the atClient SDKs; as a 
result, the payloads of the messages the programs send to each other are all 
end-to-end encrypted.

In brief
- The client (`sshnp`) creates a unique guid for the session
  - and sends a request notification to the `sshrvd` for a port1/port2 pair
    for this sessionId
- The sshrvd
  - finds a pair of available ports
  - opens server sockets for both of them
    - **Note**: rvd will allow just a single client socket to connect to each 
      server socket
      - and will bridge them together
  - sends response to the client
- The client
  - receives the response notification from sshrvd (rv_host, rv_port_1, 
    rv_port_2)
  - and sends a request notification to the `sshnpd` including the sessionId 
    and the rv_host:rv_port_1
- The daemon (`sshnpd`)
  - opens a socket to the rv_host:rv_port_1
  - and opens a socket to its local sshd port
  - and bridges the sockets together
  - and sends a response notification to the `sshnp` client
- The client
  - issues an ssh command like this to set up the ssh tunnel and do a local 
    port forwarding
    ```
    /usr/bin/ssh gary@85.239.63.180 -p 40189 -i /Users/gary/.ssh/noports \
      -L 58358:localhost:22 -t -t -f \
      -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new -o IdentitiesOnly=yes \
      -o BatchMode=yes -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes \
      sleep 15
    ```
- The client displays a message to the user that they may now
  `ssh -p $local_port $username@localhost`, i.e. `ssh -p 58358 
  gary@localhost` in the example above, and exits

This high-level flow is visualized in the diagrams below.

**NB** Requests from unauthorized client atSigns are ignored. Note that one
may also completely prevent requests from any other atSigns ever even
reaching the daemon by using the atProtocol's `config:allow` list feature.
> In the personal edition of noports, a daemon may have only a single
> authorized client atSign.
>
> The Team and Enterprise editions will allow for multiple authorized client
> atSigns, controlled not by the daemon but by a separate noports
> authorization controller process, with its own atSign.

### Control plane
In the following sequence diagram, atServer address lookup flows, 
authentication flows, key exchange flows, precise encryption mechanics and 
notification transmission flows are not covered in detail; those details are 
provided in the links provided in the "Further Details" section below.

Since the full details are provided in those other links, the 
`client_1 -> atServer_1 -> atServer_2 -> client_2`
message flows are abbreviated to `@atSign_1 -> @atSign_2` in the 
sequence diagram. Thus, for example, `sshnp (@client)` encapsulates both the 
sshnp program and the sshnp atServer

```mermaid

    participant R as sshrvd (@rv)
    participant D as sshnpd (@device)

    note over R,D: service startups

    D->D: Start monitor <br> (notification listener)

    R->R: Start monitor <br> (notification listener)

    note left of C: user runs the sshnp program
    C->C: Authentication

    C->>R: Send notification to @rv <br> requesting host and port
    
    R->R: Decrypt request payload
    R->R: Find two unused ports
    R->R: Create an isolate <br> which creates server sockets <br> on the ports, waits for connections, <br> and joins their i/o streams
    R->R: Create and encrypt <br> response message containing <br> sessionId, host, port_1, port_2
    R->>C: Send response notification <br> to @client
    
    C->C: Create and encrypt request message <br> to send to @device (sessionId, host, port1)
    C->>D: Send request to sshnpd
    D->>D: SPAWN an sshrv process
    D->>R: (Spawned) Open socket $npd_to_rv to host:port_1
    D->>D: (Spawned) Open socket $npd_to_sshd to localhost:22
    D->>D: (Spawned) Join $npd_to_rv and $npd_to_sshd <br> i/o streams, and vice versa
    D->>C: Send "connected" response notification if spawned successfully
    C->>C: Find an available $local_port<br>or use one supplied by the user via the command line
    C->>C: Spawn an initial ssh command to set up the local port forwarding tunnel
    C->>C: If spawned successfully, Write to stdout: "ssh -p $local_port $username@localhost"
```

### Data plane
Once the interactions above have completed
- the sshnpd nor the sshnp programs are no longer involved
- there is a new sshrv process running on the device host which pipes i/o 
  between device port 22 and $rv_host:$rv_port_1 
- there is an ssh process running on the client host which provides the 
  local port forwarding tunnel
- User may now type "ssh -p $local_port username@localhost" with traffic flowing 
  - client ssh program <===>
    - $client_localhost:$local_port <===> bridged by client-side ssh tunnel to
      - $rv_host:$rv_port_2 <===> bridged by sshrvd to
        - $rv_host:$rv_port_1 <===> bridged by device-side sshrv to
          - $device_host:22 <===>
            - device sshd program

## Further Details
In the sections above, we referred to "authentication", "sending 
notifications" and "receiving notifications", and we made the statement that
"the payloads of the messages the programs send to each other are all
end-to-end encrypted"
