# üñ•Ô∏è RDP

## Overview

In this guide, we demonstrate how to use the NoPorts Tunnel to RDP on a remote development machine to localhost:3389 so we can access the RDP service locally.

The command should look like:

```bash
npt -f @alice_client -t @alice_device -d my_server -r @rv_am -p 3389 -l 33389
```

Now you can connect to localhost:33899 in your favorite RDP client.
