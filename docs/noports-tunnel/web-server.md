# üåê Web Server

Here, we demonstrate how to use the NoPorts Tunnel to bridge a web server on a remote development machine to localhost:80 so we can access the web server locally.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
We are assuming that the web server is running on port `8080`, you can replace it with the port that your web server is running on.
{% endhint %}

\
The command should look like:

```bash
npt -f @alice_client -t @alice_device -d my_server -r @rv_am -p 8080 -l 80
```

Now you can access localhost:80 in your browser to access the web server locally.
