# ⚖️ Installs at scale

## Important Notes

This is an engineering guide, not a definitive solution, as every production environment is different. Feel free to borrow what is useful and ignore what is not. If you have better ideas or ways, please let us know!

### Other considerations

Each atSign has a reasonable maximum of 25 devices that it can manage, so keep that in mind as you use this script to roll out devices. By default, the hostname is used as the `-d`DEVICE\_NAME. Your hostnames may not match the requirements of the DEVICE\_NAME flag.

* Lowercase Alphanumeric max 15 Characters Snake Case before version 5.0.3
* Case insensitive Alphanumeric max 36 Chars Snake Case from version 5.0.3 onwards.
  * allows UUID snake cased device names.

## Install.sh

Cut and paste this script and tailor it to your needs. Do not forget to chmod 500 or else it will not run! More details below on how to set things up, and a demo run, too, using Docker.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

### Set up your environment.

Each atSign has its own set of keys that are "cut" with at\_activate. This will cut the keys for the atSign and place them in `~/.atsign/keys`. Each machine requires the atKeys file to run sshnpd, so, we need to have a way to get them to each device. It is possible to ssh/scp them, but that becomes very cumbersome at scale. Instead, we encrypt the keys with AES256 and place them on a webserver. When the install script is run, it knows both the URL and the encryption password and can pull the atKeys file to the right place.

The steps are to (1) get the atKeys file as normal using at\_activate, then (2) encrypt them using a command like this:

```
mkdir enckeys
cd enckeys
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 1000000 -salt -in ~/.atsign/keys/@ssh_1_key.atKeys -out @ssh_1_key.atKeys.aes
```

This command will ask you for a password which you will put in the `install.sh` file as `ATKEY_PASSWORD`.

You can then set up a simple http (the file is encrypted) server to serve the keys with. For example, a Python single line of code:

`python3 -m http.server 8080 --bind 0`

Alternatively, you can put the keys file on filebin.net and it will locate the file in a random URL which you can put into the `install.sh` file. For example:

`https://filebin.net/s2w5r6gwemmz5kvi/_ssh_1_key.atKeys.aes`

It is worth noting that the `@` gets translated to a `_` but that does not effect the script. Using this site has the advantage that the URL is hidden, and it uses TLS—plus you can delete the files once completed.

At this point you can derive the URL of the encrypted atKeys file and put it in the `install.sh` file headers.

```
export ATKEYS_URL="http://192.168.1.61:8080/@ssh_1_key.atKeys.aes"
# This is the AES password you used to encrypt the above file
export ATKEY_PASSWORD="helloworld12345!"
```

The other variables should be straightforward enough.

```
export USERNAME=ubuntu
export PASSWORD="changeme"
export CONFIG_URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cconstab/sshnpd_config/main/config/sshnpd.sh"
```

Gist for sshnpd config file
{% endembed %}

The other variables set up the atSigns for the manager and device and for the device name itself. The device name by default uses the `hostname` using the shell command `$(hostname)` , but that only works if the hostname is compliant with the `-d` format of sshnpd. You can pick another way to identify the host or just make sure the hostname is compliant.

## Running the install.sh (Note: Has to be run as root)

This is a simple matter now of getting the install.sh to the target device and running it. The needed files will be installed, the username name created, cronjobs put in place, and the 'sshnpd' will be started.

How you get the `install.sh` file to the target machine is going to vary depending on your environment. Using scp is a good option, as is using ssh or curl and pulling the file (using the same encryption method perhaps).

## Scaling things up

The install.sh script works fine on individual machines, but if you want to install on, say, 25 machines, this is how you do it.

First, you need to have ssh root access to the machines you want to install on. _This SSH access will be removed as you do the install with this line uncommented:_

```bash
#sed -i 's/#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0/ListenAddress 127.0.0.1/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

If you pass 8 arguments into the install.sh they will be used rather than the hardcoded values. This allows you to pass in the values needed as the script is run QED.

For example:

`./install.sh ubuntu changeme https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cconstab/sshnpd_config/main/config/sshnpd.sh http://192.168.1.61:8080/@ssh_1_key.atKeys.aes helloworld @cconstab @ssh_1 $(hostname)`

## To test this

Using Docker is the simple way to test any options first before moving to production.

Something like this will mount the script and start a basic Linux build:

`docker run -it -v ./install.sh:/root/install.sh debian:trixie-slim`

You can then cd and run the `install.sh` script. For example:

```
╰$ docker run -it -v ./install.sh:/root/install.sh debian:trixie-slim
root@f5040633c8a0:/# cd
root@f5040633c8a0:~# ls
install.sh
root@f5040633c8a0:~# ./install.sh 
```

After the install has completed, you can su - to the USERNAME you chose and see tmux/sshnpd running.

```
root@f5040633c8a0:~# su - ubuntu
ubuntu@f5040633c8a0:~$ tmux ls
sshnpd: 1 windows (created Sun Mar  3 22:48:01 2024)
ubuntu@f5040633c8a0:~$ 
```

On another machine, you can log in to the container using the select MANAGER\_ATSIGN, remembering to give the daemon a ssh key and the username.

```
