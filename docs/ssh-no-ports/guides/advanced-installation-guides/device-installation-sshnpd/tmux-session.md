# Tmux session

## 1. Run the installer

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Linux" %}
1. First, ensure tmux is installed on your machine:

```sh
[[ -n $(command -v tmux) ]] && echo 'Good to go!' || echo 'Uh oh! Install tmux before continuing...'
```

If tmux is not available, a quick web search of `Install tmux for <your distro>` should help you easily install it. Most distros include the tmux package in their repository.

2. Change directories into the unpacked download:

```sh
cd sshnp
```

3. Then run the installer:

```sh
./install.sh tmux sshnpd
```

This will install the binaries to `~/.local/bin`.\
Instead, if you'd like to install the binaries to `/usr/local/bin`, run the installer as root:

```sh
sudo ./install.sh tmux sshnpd
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="macOS" %}
1. First, ensure tmux is installed on your machine:

```sh
[[ -n $(command -v tmux) ]] && echo 'Good to go!' || echo 'Uh oh! Install tmux before continuing...'
```

If tmux is not available, the recommended way to install tmux on macOS is with [homebrew](https://brew.sh).

```sh
[[ -n $(command -v brew) ]] && brew install tmux || echo 'brew not installed, first install brew at https://brew.sh, then run this command again.'
```

2. Change directories into the unpacked download:

```sh
cd sshnp
```

3. Then run the installer:

```sh
./install.sh tmux sshnpd
```

This will install the binaries to `~/.local/bin`.\
Instead, if you'd like to install the binaries to `/usr/local/bin`, run the installer as root:

```sh
sudo ./install.sh tmux sshnpd
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## 2. Configure the startup script

After installing the startup script, we must configure it, with `nano` or `vi` depending on your preference.

```bash
nano ~/.local/bin/sshnpd.sh
```

or

```bash
vi ~/.local/bin/sshnpd.sh
```

You'll then be greeted with a file that looks like this:

{% @github-files/github-code-block url="https://github.com/atsign-foundation/noports/blob/trunk/packages/dart/sshnoports/bundles/shell/headless/sshnpd.sh" %}

Replace `$user` with the [linux user ](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]running sshnpd

Replace `$device_atsign` with the [device address](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]

Replace `$manager_atsign` with the [client address](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]

Replace `$device_name` with your own [custom **unique
** identifier](#user-content-fn-4)[^4] for this device. You will need this
value later, so don't forget it.
{% hint style="info" %}
`$device_name` must be alphanumeric snake case, max length 30 - e.g. dev_abc1
{% endhint %}

Add any additional config to the end of the line where sshnpd is run, some useful flags you should consider adding:

* `-u` : "unhide" the device, sharing the username and making it discoverable by `sshnp --list-devices`
* `-s` : "ssh-public-key", allow ssh public keys to be shared by sshnp and automatically authorized by sshd, saves you from dealing with ssh public key management. If multiple people use the device, we recommend leaving this off and managing ssh public keys yourself.
* To see the rest of the available options run sshnpd to see the usage.

## 3. Activate your device address

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you don't own a pair of noports addresses, please visit [the registrar](https://my.noports.com/no-ports-invite/14dayfreetrial) before continuing.
{% endhint %}

### 3.a. First time activating your address

We will now activate the device address, you only need to activate the device address now. The client address will be activated later during the client installation.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Linux" %}
Now that you have at\_activate installed, you can invoke the command with the name of the address you would like to activate:

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>./at_activate -a @my_noports_device
</strong></code></pre>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="macOS" %}
Now that you have at\_activate installed, you can invoke the command with the name of the address you would like to activate:

```bash
./at_activate -a @my_noports_device
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Enter the One Time Password (OTP)  & Check your SPAM folder!

The application will pause and wait for the input of a one time pin (OTP) before you can continue. You should receive this pin to the contact information associated with the registration of your noports address (i.e. email or text message). \
\
\*\*\*If you are using a gmail.com account we have seen that sometimes the OTP gets stuck in the SPAM or PROMOTIONS folder. If you do not see the OTP check those folders.&#x20;

Once you receive the message, enter the pin into the application and press enter to continue. The application should proceed to create the cryptographic keys and store them at [`~/.atsign/keys/<address_name>_key.atKeys`](#user-content-fn-5)[^5].&#x20;

An address can only be activated once, to install this address to future devices, you must copy this file to the device (see 3.b.).

### 3.b. Activated this address before

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you have activated the device address before, you must copy the address from another machine where it's been activated.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The address will be located at [`~/.atsign/keys/<address_name>_key.atKeys`](#user-content-fn-6)[^6]. Copy this file from your other machine to the same location on the machine that you are installing sshnpd on.

## 4. Start the service

The tmux service will automatically be started by the `cron @reboot` directive when your machine restarts. If you would like to start it immediately, note that you must make sure to disown the tmux process so that it doesn't hangup when you logout.

Run the following command to start it immediately:

```bash
nohup &>/dev/null tmux new-session -d -s sshnpd && tmux send-keys -t sshnpd $HOME/.local/bin/sshnpd.sh C-m
```

### Observing the service

You can use regular tmux commands to observe the service:

```bash
tmux a -t sshnpd
```

{% hint style="info" %}
To detach from the tmux session use the keybind `Ctrl + B, D`.  This will safely detach from the tmux session without killing it.
{% endhint %}

## 5. All done!

Your tmux session is ready to go, you can now proceed to [installing your client](../client-installation-sshnp.md), or if you've already done that, checkout our [usage guide](../../usage-guide/basic-usage/).

[^1]: If you aren't sure, type "echo $USER" in your terminal.

[^2]: e.g. @alice\_device

[^3]: e.g. @alice\_client

[^4]: This device name is how you distinguish between all of the devices you have running sshnpd.

[^5]: where `<address_name>` is the name of your device address e.g. `@alice_device`

[^6]: where `<address_name>` is the name of your device address e.g. `@alice_device`
