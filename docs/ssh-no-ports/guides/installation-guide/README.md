# ðŸ’½ Installation Guide

## Overview

The installation guide is broken up into three parts. You may start with either the [client installation](client-installation-sshnp.md), or the [device installation](device-installation-sshnpd.md). The [activate an address](activate-an-address-a.k.a.-atsign.md) guide is a supplementary guide which is referred to by both the client and device installation guides.
