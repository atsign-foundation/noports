# Device installation

## Overview

The SSH No Ports daemon (a.k.a. sshnpd) is installable as a background service in many ways depending on your environment you can choice your best option. The service may be installed as a `systemd unit`, `docker container`, `tmux session`, or as a background job using `cron` and `nohup`. The binaries can also be installed standalone so that you can install your own custom background service.

### No Windows Support

We currently don't offer sshnpd as part of our releases. \
