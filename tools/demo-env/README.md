NoPorts using docker containers and networks to isolate various components.

## Usage

There are two services running inside each of the device containers:

1. openssh server
2. nginx server

The @bobðŸ›  container also supports remote desktop passthrough back to the host.

### Setup

Add the following entries to `/etc/hosts` on your host machine:

```txt
# Hostnames in docker that we want to loop back to
127.0.0.1 vip.ve.atsign.zone
127.0.0.1 relay1.atsign.zone
127.0.0.1 relay2.atsign.zone
```

Setup docker environment with docker compose:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

Source the client utility file:

> Do this step every time you open a new shell

```sh
source client.sh
```

### Run client

Then run `noports` to see the usage. Change the atSigns in the input to
`noports` as needed, refer to table above for options.

> `noports` will not run commands for you, but it will print commands to the
> terminal which you may copy/paste, or wrap with `$()` to run automatically  
> e.g. `$(noports @colin @alice @jagan ssh)`
